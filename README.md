# Milk-Profitability-COMP609
Application to calculate the profitability of a list of livestock.


Task: inheritance and polymorphism
weight 6%
Task: Consider a text file where each line contains the information as described below.
- Id, 
- amount of milk, 
- typeId: an integer (a unique number)
- Amount of milk: double that indicates the number of litres per day.
- Type: String which is either Goat, Cow or Jersey_Cow - For example: 1111, 22.3, Jersey_Cow.

Develop a GUI application that reads the text file and also receive from the user (in a textbox):
1.Price of cow milk (New Jersey or normal Cow: price is the same)
2.Cost of vaccination for Cow
3.Cost of vaccination for Jersey Cow
4.Cost of Goat vaccination

Assume the text file contains 10 lines. For each line, your application must create an object and storeall objects in an array. After storing all objects in the array, the application displays the total profitability upon request from the user. The profitability of a livestock is calculated as the income from milk minus the cost of vaccination. 

Your application must demonstrate inheritance and polymorphisim.
